# Building
The building process currently uses a simple batch file</br>
Follow this tutorial by shygoo for setting up armips https://hack64.net/Thread-Importing-C-Code-Into-SM64-Using-n64chain-and-armips</br>
Once armips is set up, clone this repo and create a new folder in the root of the repo named `rom`</br>
Place a vanilla, mp1 rom named `mp1.z64` in the `rom` folder</br>
Run `build.bat` and it will generate your new modded rom in the `rom` folder named `mp1.mod.z64`
